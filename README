This is an unofficial build script that builds a toolchain that can compile C and C++ programs for the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 microcontroller. It also builds ev3duder and EV3-API libraries created by the c4ev3 project (https://github.com/c4ev3/).

Currently, only Linux and FreeBSD are supported. Support for other platforms is planned to be added in the future.

To run this script, just run:

# make

This will build a GCC 4.5.1/Binutils 2.22 toolchain and install it into /opt/timkoisoft/legoev3-toolchain. If you want a GCC 7.4.0/Binutils 2.30 toolchain instead, then run this command instead:

# make MODERN=1

Notice that only the GCC 4.5.1 version of the LEGO EV3 toolchain was tested, so use the GCC 7.4.0 one at your own risk.

If you want to install the toolchain into a different directory, set the "prefix" (without quotes) environment variable to the path where you would like to install GCC. For example:

# export prefix=/usr/local/legogcctoolchain

Then run make.

While the Makefile is licensed under the OpenBSD/ISC License, the patches in the patches/ folder are not. See the patches/ folder for more info.
